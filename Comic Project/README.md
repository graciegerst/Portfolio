After learning the basics of SQL I wanted to start a project with my own raw data in order to get a better grasp on the language, rather than using some dummy data I found online that was already cleaned up.

I have a Google Sheet for my comics that was formatted to make it easy for me to keep track of everything, but doesn't look very good in SQL, so I exported it to Excel and converted to a CSV so it could be uploaded to MySQL Workbench. My comics_cleanup file is my current progress cleaning up this table.


CONTENTS:

<ul>
  <li>Comics.xlsx - Excel spreadsheet of comics data</li>
  <li>comics_cleaup.sql - SQL code (in progress)</li>
