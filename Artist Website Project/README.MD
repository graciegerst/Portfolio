This is a project I was working on for an artist friend in order to practice HTML and CSS. The website would act as her portfolio as well as a place to contact her and buy her work. I've intentionally not included any pictures in this upload since the art does not belong to me and this project is in progress.

CONTENTS:

HTML files for contact page, home page, portfolio page, and shop page:

    contact.html
    home.html
    portfolio.html
    shop.html

CSS file to be applied to all HTML pages:

    styles.css
